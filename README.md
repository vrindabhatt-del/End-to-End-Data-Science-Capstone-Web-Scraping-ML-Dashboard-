## 🔍 Project Overview
In this project, real-world data is collected directly from a public website using web scraping techniques.  
The goal is to showcase how unstructured online data can be transformed into valuable insights and predictive intelligence.

The project includes:
- Web scraping
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory analysis & visualization
- Machine learning model building
- Interactive dashboard development
- Business insights & recommendations

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Extract data from the web without relying on pre-cleaned datasets
- Convert raw HTML responses into structured tables
- Build insights-driven analysis for trends and patterns
- Develop a predictive model (clustering/classification/regression)
- Present findings clearly through dashboards and reports

---

## 📂 Project Components
### 1️⃣ Web Scraping  
- Python-based scraping script (BeautifulSoup / requests / Selenium / API requests)  
- Scraped **1,000+ usable records**  
- Stored results in `.csv`

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Removed duplicates & missing values  
- Standardized formats  
- Converted numeric/regex fields  
- Feature engineering where needed

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Descriptive statistics  
- Trend charts & distributions  
- Category-level comparisons  
- Outlier detection & patterns

### 4️⃣ Model Building  
- Machine learning pipeline  
- Algorithms used:
  - Regression / Classification / Clustering (based on dataset)
- Evaluated with accuracy, RMSE, silhouette score, etc.

### 5️⃣ Dashboard Visualization  
Interactive dashboard using:
- **Power BI / Tableau / Streamlit / Plotly Dash**
Features included:
- KPIs & trends
- Filters & drill-through
- Slicers, bookmarks, & custom visuals

### 6️⃣ Final Reporting  
- Video demo (5+ minutes) explaining approach & results  
- Insight summary + recommendations  
- PDF report with visuals & conclusions

---

## 📈 Sample Outcomes
- Extracted structured data from web
- Discovered trends such as popular products/categories/reviews (depending on domain)
- Built an ML model to predict or segment outcomes
- Designed a dashboard for decision-makers to explore insights
- Delivered recommendations based on analysis

---

## 💡 Business Value
This project simulates real analytics consulting work:
- Turning messy web data into clean datasets
- Building models that forecast or segment
- Sharing insights visually to support decisions
